# That was its name

A cornerstone of **Origami** is a *Processing Schema*.

There are two logically separated types of schemas: internal- and external- ones. Each of them describes the changes of the source code in terms of *abstract syntax tree* nodes that could be processed and applied to the linked target .class file.

*Internal processing schema* describes a peace of changes that will be implemented in *every single* generated microservice. You don't need to worry about this one until you want to change something in a common service stub generated by the plugin.

*External processing schema* is just a chunk of java <code>.class</code> files linked with current microservice repository. It contains some logically connected changes of the source code that are peculiar to *the current microservice only*. All you need to start development of external schema class is to get [origami-api](https://github.com/NickyKlaus/origami-api) and implement [<code>ASTProcessingSchema</code>](https://github.com/NickyKlaus/origami-api/blob/master/src/main/java/com/home/origami/api/ASTProcessingSchema.java) interface.
